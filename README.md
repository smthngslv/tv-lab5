# Run
Start services. 
```shell
docker compose up -d
```
Now you can go to the http://localhost:15672' to RabbitMQ rates, use `tv` 
as login and password. Also, you can access PostgreSQL with same login and password.

# Task #1

# Task #2
I've implemented consumer in './src/lab5/queue/consumer.py'. It consumes messages
from the queue and inserts it in two different `PostgreSQL` tables depending on 
it type.

In docker file I use base `python:3.10` image, install dependencies, create a 
non-root user, copy source code and configs. 

Variables are passed via environment.

You can build and push image via `docker`
```shell
docker build -t smthngslv/tv-lab5:latest .
docker push smthngslv/tv-lab5:latest
```
or `docker compose`
```shell
docker compose build
docker compose push
```

# Task #3
In `docker-compose.yaml` file I've declared 4 services. They are consumer, 
producer, rabbitmq and postgres. For all services I've set limits for CPU and RAM.
Also, in URLs, that help to connect to RabbitMQ or PostgreSQL I use hosts like
`postgres` and `rabbitmq`. These hosts are generated by docker compose and are
accessible inside the containers. Also, I map port for RabbitMQ management plugin.

# Task #4
